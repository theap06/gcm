GCM is a set of tools used to do at-scale monitoring for HPC (High-Performance Computing) clusters, it powers [Meta FAIR (Fundamental AI Research)](https://ai.meta.com/research/) AI workloads across hundreds of thousands of GPUs at Meta.

GCM is a monorepo with the following components:

- [Monitoring](gcm/monitoring/): Collects cluster statistics from the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) workload scheduler, providing visibility into job performance and resource utilization.
- [Health Checks](gcm/health_checks/): Verifies the proper functioning of hardware, software, network, storage, and services throughout the job lifecycle.
- [Telemetry Processor / GPU Metrics](gcm/slurmprocessor/): Enhances OpenTelemetry data by correlating telemetry with Slurm metadata, enabling attribution of metrics (e.g., GPU utilization) to specific jobs and users.

## Contributing

Each component has its own README with detailed guides:

- [Monitoring](gcm/README.md)
- [Health Checks](gcm/README.md)
- [slurmprocessor](slurmprocessor/README.md)
- [shelper](shelper/README.md)

## Possible Expansions

- Integration with more GPU types (AMD, Intel, Custom Accelerators)
- Support for additional schedulers beyond Slurm
- [Additional Slurm related Monitoring](gcm/docs/monitoring_onboarding.md#monitoring-something-new-with-gcm)
- [Support for new exporters](gcm/docs/monitoring_onboarding.md#adding-a-new-exporter-to-gcm)
- Adding support for [Slurm REST API](https://slurm.schedmd.com/rest_api.html) querying
- Adding support for new [Health Checks](gcm/docs/health_checks_onboarding.md#how-to-write-a-new-health-check?)
- Distribution via Docker Images and Helm Charts
