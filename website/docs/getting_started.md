# Getting Started

## Introduction

GCM is a set of tools used to do at-scale monitoring for HPC (High-Performance Computing) clusters, it powers [Meta FAIR (Fundamental AI Research)](https://ai.meta.com/research/) AI workloads across over hundreds of thousands of GPUs at Meta.

GCM is a monorepo with the following components:

- [GCM Monitoring](./GCM_Monitoring/getting_started): Continuous data collection, mostly for the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) workload scheduler, providing visibility into job performance and resource utilization.
- [GCM Health Checks](./GCM_Health_Checks/getting_started): Verifies the proper functioning of hardware, software, network, storage, and services throughout the job lifecycle.
- [GCM GPU Metrics](./GCM_GPU_Metrics/getting_started): Enhances OpenTelemetry data by correlating telemetry with Slurm metadata, enabling attribution of metrics (e.g., GPU utilization) to specific jobs and users.
